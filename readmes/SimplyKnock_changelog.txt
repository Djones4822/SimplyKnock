Simply Knock

Change Log

===================================================
Release 1.0.5 (2/8/2016)

Features and Changes
    "Welcome Duration" (how long you can stay once permitted entry) and "Failure Timeout" (how long it takes before you can request entry again after failing) are now separate options.

Bug Fixes

    Dogs can no longer answer the door.

    Better handling of cases (like Chillfurrow Farm) where the door has no owner, but the cell is owned by a single actor.


Release 1.0.4 (2/7/2016)

Bug Fixes

    The mod now correctly checks whether or not an actor found in the linked cell is disabled or not. This prevents actors that are disabled until a certain event has occurred (i.e. Calder the House Carl in Hjerim) from answering the door incorrectly.

    If a cell is owned by a single actor instead of a faction (rare), the mod now correctly checks that the actor owner is alive and enabled.


Release 1.0.3 (2/6/2016)

Features and Changes

    Added support for compatibility patches for SkyRe, PerMa, and possibly other mods as needed for compatibility patching

    Added SkyRe compatibility patch. See Files section.

    Added PerMa compatibility patch. See Files section.

    Removed the "Alternate Door Menu" option. Recent changes to the main door menu made it unnecessary.

Release 1.0.2 (2/6/2016)

Features and Changes

    Added "Use Alternate Door Menu" option to the Config Menu. This will improve compatibility with Address Unknown (menu will no longer show the destination of the door). However, this option will be less compatible with other mods that override door activation to add additional choices to the menu; only "Knock", "Leave", and "Unlock" will display when this is enabled.

    The Knock menu no longer displays when sneaking; you are taken directly to the lock pick screen.

Bug Fixes

    Fixed a case where children could answer the door when an adult was home.

    Fixed a bug where the bribe dialogue option for children was not appearing.


Release 1.0.1 (2/5/2016)

Bug Fixes

    Fixed a bug wherein, after being permitted entry into a residence, all of the residence's belongings were flagged as already owned by the player (i.e. nothing could be "stolen", only "taken").

Release 1.0 (2/5/2016)

Initial release.
